# savings-tracker

The savings tracker is an application that allows users to input their savings, investments, and debt information across time. It then displays a series of charts and graphs to show total investments, debt, and savings as well as trends over time. Additionally, the savings tracker application (FinalProject.py) can be used with the investment calculator microservice (investmentcalcmicro.py) to calculate the users projected future earnings. I designed the tracker in CS 361: Software Engineering. The investment calculator microservice was designed by my partner in this class. This project uses a command line interface.
